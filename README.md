# Advanced Search Engine for Academic Research

## Description
This project develops a sophisticated search engine tailored for academic research. It systematically indexes Wikipedia articles, providing precise and efficient information retrieval. Utilizing the Vector Space Model (VSM) and K-means clustering, this engine optimizes search capabilities for a large corpus of textual content. Additionally, it includes a comparison of the VSM and BM25 models to highlight their strengths and areas for improvement.

## Features
- **Structured Dataset:** Utilizes Wikipedia articles with detailed attributes such as ID, URL, title, and body text.
- **Search Models:** Integrates and compares the Vector Space Model (VSM) with the BM25 model.
- **Text Processing:** Implements tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Clustering:** Uses K-means clustering to group articles into relevant clusters for optimized search precision.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Employs metrics such as Indexing Accuracy and Retrieval Performance, which include Query Response Efficiency and Ranking Effectiveness.
